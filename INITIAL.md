## Narrative

As a product manager, I describe my vision for a new customer support chatbot to Claude Code. The system immediately understands this requires the full product development workflow and generates a Discovery Agent that begins researching similar solutions, identifying user pain points, and validating market demand. Once discovery completes, a Specification Agent takes the research and creates detailed technical requirements, database schemas, and API specifications. The Design Agent then creates user interface mockups and interaction flows based on these specs. Throughout this process, I can see exactly what each agent is working on, review their outputs, and provide feedback that automatically propagates to dependent stages. When I approve the designs, the Implementation Agent begins coding with perfect context about user needs, technical requirements, and design specifications, while the Validation Agent prepares comprehensive test plans. The entire process feels like having a specialized expert for each domain, working in perfect coordination.
